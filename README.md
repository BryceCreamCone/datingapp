## Demo
This is my demo dating app service! If you're interested I have seeded some data already. You can log in as any of the current users using the same password of 'password'.
The usernames are:
  Lola
  Dorothy
  Reba
  Annmarie
  Ashley
  Roy
  Duke
  Lloyd
  Larsen
  Simon

## How to use
The app features a messaging system, a like system, photo uploads, profile management, and filters for searches.
As you can see, I've already tested it with Roy and Lola.

To message a user - simply sign in and hover over that member's photo. From there three icons will pop up.

You'll notice that I've already had some messages between Roy and Lola. Feel free to send messages still, however!

You can also access the messages from the messages tab, which bring you to your messages page

## Edit Profile
You can edit a profile by clicking on the user's name in the upper right hand corner (where it says "Welcome, username"). From there there is a dropdown to edit the profile or log out. If you edit the profile you have access to both text and pictures.

You can choose which of the pictures you'd like to become your "Main" by clicking on "Main". I have uploaded a second photo for Roy in case you wanted to test it out, but feel free to upload another picture to test the functionality! I won't claim it or use it in any way besides this demo, and you're free to simply delete it after.
